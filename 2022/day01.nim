First day of new year of advent of code, happy to be back here having fun with [nim]
and [nimib] and blogging about it. The idea for this year is to try and make visualization
with [p5nim].

ðŸ‘‡[shortcut for visualization](#viz)

Another thing I will be doing is using [batteries] for importing common stdlib modules.
This is a nice convenience module that was supposed to improve on pattern of doing `include prelude`
but it was [decided not to] put it in stdlib and you can now install it with [nimble].

Solving any puzzle you take a lot of micro decision.
Often I like to separate parsing and processing, but in cases like today
it is very convenient to do both at once:

another issue: SIGSEGV: Illegal storage access. (Attempt to read from nil?)

-> this might be a bug in orc (in my current nim 1.6.6)! if I remove orc it works!
