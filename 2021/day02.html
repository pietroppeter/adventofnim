<h2>Day 2: <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2">Dive!</a> üö£‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h2>
<p>Let's start from the <em>title</em>. Last year titles were all two words, with today's title
(Dive!) we break this recent tradition (in the past there were longer titles).
Were there other days with <em>single word</em> titles in the past? Is there a list
of titles used? The best I could come up with is
<a href="https://github.com/narimiran/AdventOfCode2020">miran's repo collection</a>,
but it seems he is also breaking tradition this year and not adding the title
to his usual nice table.</p>
<p>Today the problem involved <em>parsing</em>, as we would all expect.
But do we really need to parse stuff?
The <a href="https://narimiran.github.io/2021/01/11/nim-parsing.html">small bible for parsing in Nim for Advent of Code</a> is again from miran.
You would think he would have covered all methods for parsing,
but in fact today I discovered there are two more:</p>
<ul>
<li>one is <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/strscans.html#scanTuple.m%2Cuntyped%2Cstatic%5Bstring%5D%2Cvarargs%5Buntyped%5D">scanTuple</a>,
which is <code>scanf</code> without the need of predeclaring the variables.
Why does miran's bible misses on that?
does he have beef with <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/16300">beef</a>?
Well, the reason is more likely to be that it was implemented after the post was written
and in fact it is another new shiny thing from 1.6, a hidden gem that
was not even mentioned in the <a href="https://nim-lang.org/blog/2021/10/19/version-160-released.html">release notes</a></li>
<li>the second apocriphal way of doing parsing is even more <em>magic</em> since
<em>you do not actually do the parsing</em> and let a <em>good old friend</em> do it.
It dawned on me during breakfast while I was <em>looking at the puzzle input</em>
and thinking about <em>an implementation</em> ü§Ø!</li>
</ul>
<p>What is it? follow along to find out!</p>
<h3>Part 1</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] the submarine can take a series of commands like forward 1, down 2, or up 3:</p>
<ul>
<li>forward X increases the horizontal position by X units.</li>
<li>down X <em>increases</em> the depth by X units.</li>
<li>up X <em>decreases</em> the depth by X units.
Note that since you're on a submarine, down and up affect your <em>depth</em>, and so they have the opposite result of what you might expect.</li>
</ul>
<p>The submarine seems to already have a planned course (your puzzle input). You should probably figure out where it's going. For example:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="nim hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">template</span> testInput =
  forward <span class="hljs-number">5</span>
  down <span class="hljs-number">5</span>
  forward <span class="hljs-number">8</span>
  up <span class="hljs-number">3</span>
  down <span class="hljs-number">8</span>
  forward <span class="hljs-number">2</span></code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Your horizontal position and depth both start at 0.</p>
<p>[...] After following these instructions, you would have a horizontal position of 15 and a depth of 10. (Multiplying these together produces 150.)</p>
<p>Calculate the horizontal position and depth you would have after following the planned course. What do you get if you multiply your final horizontal position by your final depth?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you see now what is the magic trick and the old friend?
Did the <em>template</em> above give it away?
Well, the trick is that the old friend that will do that parsing is
Nim compiler and I will just have to <code>include</code> the input (which I have saved in a nim file):</p>
<pre><code class="nim hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span>
  solution: <span class="hljs-built_in">int</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">template</span> solve = solution = pos.x*pos.d</code></pre>
<pre><code class="nim hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> pos: <span class="hljs-keyword">tuple</span>[x, d: <span class="hljs-built_in">int</span>]
<span class="hljs-keyword">template</span> down(n: <span class="hljs-built_in">int</span>) = pos.d += n
<span class="hljs-keyword">template</span> up(n: <span class="hljs-built_in">int</span>) = pos.d -= n
<span class="hljs-keyword">template</span> forward(n: <span class="hljs-built_in">int</span>) = pos.x += n
<span class="hljs-keyword">template</span> reset = pos = (<span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>)
testInput
solve
<span class="hljs-keyword">assert</span> solution == <span class="hljs-number">150</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># real input</span>
reset
<span class="hljs-keyword">include</span> input02
solve
<span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> solution</code></pre>
<pre><samp>2322630
</samp></pre>
<p>That's the right answer! You are <em class="star">one gold star</em> closer to saving your vacation.</p>
<h3>Part 2</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on your calculations, the planned course doesn't seem to make any sense. You find the submarine manual and discover that the process is actually slightly more complicated.</p>
<p>In addition to horizontal position and depth, you'll also need to track a third value, <em>aim</em>, which also starts at 0. The commands also mean something entirely different than you first thought:</p>
<ul>
<li>down X <em>increases</em> your aim by X units.</li>
<li>up X <em>decreases</em> your aim by X units.</li>
<li>forward X does two things:
<ul>
<li>It increases your horizontal position by X units.</li>
<li>It increases your depth by your aim <em>multiplied by</em> X.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>[...] Now, the above example [...] you would have a horizontal position of 15 and a depth of 60. (Multiplying these produces <em>900</em>.)</p>
<p>Using this new interpretation of the commands, calculate the horizontal position and depth you would have after following the planned course. <em>What do you get if you multiply your final horizontal position by your final depth?</em></p>
