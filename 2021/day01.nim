Another year of Advent of Nim :christmas_tree::crown:!

_This year I would like to try and use cool nim libraries
for visualization_ and similar stuff.
I will most likely be able to keep up only for a few days, but let's see.

But let's get to the first problem.
As usual we have a sequence of integers as input.

What is new this year is that,
[thanks to 1.6](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2021/10/19/version-160-released.html)
we can use `toSeq` with method call syntax!

> As the submarine drops below the surface of the ocean, it automatically performs a sonar sweep of the nearby sea floor.

The solution for part1 (as expected) is pretty straightforward.
Just make sure you start from index 1:
