### Part 1

> The diagnostic report (your puzzle input) consists of a list of binary numbers which, when decoded properly, can tell you many useful things about the conditions of the submarine. The first parameter to check is the _power consumption_.
> 
> You need to use the binary numbers in the diagnostic report to generate two new binary numbers (called the _gamma rate_ and the _epsilon rate_). The power consumption can then be found by multiplying the gamma rate by the epsilon rate.
> 
> Each bit in the gamma rate can be determined by finding the _most common bit in the corresponding position_ of all numbers in the diagnostic report. For example, given the following diagnostic report:

nbText: """
> Considering only the first bit of each number, there are five 0 bits and seven 1 bits. Since the most common bit is 1, the first bit of the gamma rate is 1.
>
> The most common second bit of the numbers in the diagnostic report is 0, so the second bit of the gamma rate is 0.
>
> The most common value of the third, fourth, and fifth bits are 1, 1, and 0, respectively, and so the final three bits of the gamma rate are 110.
>
> So, the gamma rate is the binary number 10110, or _22_ in decimal.
>
> The epsilon rate is calculated in a similar way; rather than use the most common bit, the least common bit from each position is used. So, the epsilon rate is 01001, or _9_ in decimal. Multiplying the gamma rate (22) by the epsilon rate (9) produces the power consumption, _198_.
>
> Use the binary numbers in your diagnostic report to calculate the gamma rate and epsilon rate, then multiply them together. _What is the power consumption of the submarine?_

I had to catch a plane this morning and the puzzle unlocked
while getting onto the plane. Luckily I was able to solve part1 in the few
minutes from the moment I sat on the plane to the moment they asked us
to turn off the devices, so I could get also the text for part2 and had
plenty of time during flight to solve it.
