Each line gives the password policy and then the password.
The password policy indicates the lowest and highest number of times
a given letter must appear for the password to be valid.
For example, 1-3 a means that the password must contain
a at least 1 time and at most 3 times.

In the above example, 2 passwords are valid.
The middle password, cdefg, is not;
it contains no instances of b, but needs at least 1.
The first and third passwords are valid:
  they contain one a or nine c,
  both within the limits of their respective policies.

_How many passwords are valid_ according to their policies?"""
