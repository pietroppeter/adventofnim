<h1>2020, Day 10, Part 2 - Hints</h1>
<p>My background being in mathematics, I do suffer a bit parse-heavy days, while I enjoy thoroughly days like today.
Below a sequence of micro-hints to help those who have the reciprocal suffering.
Following them all the way should result in something similar to my implementation,
but you might want to stop earlier and come up with your own version.</p>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>You have to implement a function <code>solve2</code> that counts all possible arrangements of a sequence of integers according to the constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>start with 0</li>
<li>any subsequent element should have a difference with the previous that is either 1, 2 or 3</li>
<li>end with max element of the sequence + 3</li>

Following them all the way should result in something similar to my implementation,

## Problem
You have to implement a function `solve2` that counts all possible arrangements of a sequence of integers according to the constraints:
* start with 0
* any subsequent element should have a difference with the previous that is either 1, 2 or 3
* end with max element of the sequence + 3

I am not really using [nim](https://nim-lang.org/) notation in the hints and they should be agnostic with respect to the programming language.
